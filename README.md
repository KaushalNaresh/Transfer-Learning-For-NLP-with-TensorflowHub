# Transfer-Learning-For-NLP-with-TensorflowHub
> Coursera guided project to understand the use of tensorflow hub


[TensorFlow Hub](https://tfhub.dev/) is a repository of pre-trained TensorFlow models.

In this project, we will use pre-trained models from TensorFlow Hub with [tf.keras](https://www.tensorflow.org/api_docs/python/tf/keras) for text classification. Transfer learning makes it possible to save training resources and to achieve good model generalization even when training on a small dataset. In this project, we will demonstrate this by training with several different TF-Hub modules.
